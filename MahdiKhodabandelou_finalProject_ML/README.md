# Accurate LPI Radar Waveform Recognition with CWD-TFA for Deep Convolutional Network

## Overview
This repository contains the simulation code for the paper **"Accurate LPI Radar Waveform Recognition with CWD-TFA for Deep Convolutional Network."** The goal of this project is to implement and validate the methods described in the paper, specifically focusing on the use of Choi-Williams Distribution Time-Frequency Analysis (CWD-TFA) and deep convolutional networks for recognizing Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) radar waveforms.

## Repository Status
**This repository is currently under development and is not yet complete.** We are actively working on implementing the methods and will be updating the repository.

## Features
- Implementation of CWD-TFA for time-frequency analysis.
- Design and training of deep convolutional networks for waveform recognition.
- Simulation results and performance metrics as described in the paper.
