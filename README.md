## Introduction

In this repository, you will find my solutions to machine learning homeworks. Each folder contains a report in Persian and a .ipynb file which contains codes.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **MahdiKhodabandelou_ML_MP1**: Solution for mini project 1 (Classification with Linear Models, LS, and RLS).
- **MahdiKhodabandelou_ML_MP1_supplementary**: Supplementary solution for mini project 1 (Classification with Linear Models, LS, and RLS).
- **MahdiKhodabandelou_ML_MP2**: Solution for mini project 2 (Neural Network Activation Functions and Perceptrons, Decision Tree, Bayesian Classification).
- **MahdiKhodabandelou_ML_MP3**: Solution for mini project 3 (Support Vector Machines (SVM) Analysis, Autoencoder).
- **MahdiKhodabandelou_ML_MP4**: Solution for mini project 4 (Q-Learning and Deep Q-Network).
- **MahdiKhodabandelou_finalProject_ML**: Accurate LPI Radar Waveform Recognition with CWD-TFA for Deep Convolutional Network.
