## Introduction

In this repository, you will find my solutions to machine learning homeworks. Each folder contains a report in persian and .ipynb file which cotains codes.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **MahdiKhodabandelou_ML_MP1**: Solution for mini project1(Classification with Linear Models, LS and RLS).
- **MahdiKhodabandelou_ML_MP1_supplementary**: Supplementary solution for mini project1(Classification with Linear Models, LS and RLS).
- **MahdiKhodabandelou_ML_MP2**: Solution for mini project2(Neural Network Activation Functions and Perceptrons, Decision tree, Bayesian Classification).
- **MahdiKhodabandelou_ML_MP3**: Solution for mini project3(Support Vector Machines (SVM) Analysis, Autoencoder).
